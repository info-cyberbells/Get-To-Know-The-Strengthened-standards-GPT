## Standard 1: The Person

### Intent of Standard 1
Standard 1 underpins the way that providers and workers are expected to treat older people and is relevant to all standards. It reflects important concepts about:
- Dignity and respect
- Older person individuality and diversity
- Independence, choice and control
- Culturally safe care
- Dignity of risk

These elements are crucial in fostering a sense of safety, autonomy, inclusion and quality of life for older people. Older people are valuable members of society, with rich and varied histories, characteristics, identities, interests and life experiences.

Older people can come from diverse backgrounds and groups, including but not limited to:
- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples
- People from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds
- People living in rural or remote areas
- People who are financially or socially disadvantaged
- Veterans
- People experiencing homelessness or at risk of becoming homeless
- Care leavers
- Parents separated from their children by forced adoption or removal
- LGBTQI+ individuals
- People experiencing mental health problems and mental illness
- People living with cognitive impairment including dementia
- People living with disability

A person's diversity does not define who they are, but it is critical that providers recognize and embrace each person's diversity and holistic identity, using this understanding to drive engagement and care delivery.
