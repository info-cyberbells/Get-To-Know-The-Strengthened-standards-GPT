# What's Different in the Strengthened Quality Standards

## Overview

The strengthened Aged Care Quality Standards are more measurable, detailed, and comprehensive. The Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety identified several focus areas for improvement, including:
- Diversity
- Governance
- Food and nutrition
- Dementia care
- Clinical care

## Key Changes

The strengthened Quality Standards set clear expectations for providers to ensure they deliver safe and quality care. They create a shared understanding of what is expected in aged care.

### Streamlined Structure
The Standards have been streamlined from 8 to 7 Standards, with:
- 13% new expectations
- 63% clarifying current expectations
- 24% aligning to current Quality Standards

### Enhanced Features
The strengthened Quality Standards:
- Are more robust and detailed
- Place older people at the center of their care
- Increase protections for older people
- Support people living with dementia
- Better include people from diverse backgrounds
- Provide stronger requirements for clinical care and food and nutrition
- Use clear language
- Minimize duplication
- Reflect the new Statement of Rights (to be included in the new Aged Care Act)

### Standard Structure
Each strengthened Quality Standard includes:
- An intent statement to add context
- An expectation statement (in first person) outlining what older people can expect
- An outcome statement (enforceable in legislation)
- Actions demonstrating how providers can meet the outcome

In total, the strengthened Quality Standards have 33 outcomes with 146 supporting actions.

## Person-Centered Care

Older people's voices and lived experiences are central to the strengthened Quality Standards. There is a strong focus on:
- Person-centered care
- The rights of older people
- Care outcomes for older people

This aligns with the intent and purpose of the new Aged Care Act.

## Older Person's Rights

Aged care providers must implement practices that uphold the rights of older people. The Statement of Rights defines key concepts:
- Person-centered care
- Privacy
- Dignity and respect
- Individuality and diversity
- Independence
- Choice and control
- Culturally safe care
- Dignity of risk (older people's right to live as they choose, even if their choices involve some risk)

Providers must demonstrate their understanding of the Statement of Rights in strengthened Quality Standard 1.

## Key Focus Areas

### Diversity and Dementia Care
Additional requirements ensure better understanding and consideration of older people's diversity, including those living with dementia.

### Clinical Care
Strengthened Quality Standard 5 is dedicated to clinical care, developed by the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care. It covers:
- Medications management
- Clinical safety
- Palliative care

### Governance
Strengthened Quality Standard 2 requires the governing body to:
- Set organizational strategic priorities
- Promote a culture of safety and quality
- Partner with older people

### Food and Nutrition
Strengthened Quality Standard 6 is dedicated to food and nutrition in residential care, aiming to improve:
- Quality and variety of meals
- Dining experience of residents

## Graded Assessment

The assessment process against the strengthened Quality Standards is changing. The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission will:

### Assessment Approach
- Audit providers based on their service offerings
- Provide graded assessments at the outcome level:
  - Conformance
  - Minor non-conformance
  - Major non-conformance

### Exceeding Grade
- Available only to residential care homes
- Based on assessment criteria (to be developed)
- Requires conformance with all strengthened Quality Standards

### Impact
- Graded assessments will affect provider Star Ratings
- Results will be displayed on the Find a provider tool
- Aims to encourage excellence in aged care service delivery
