## Overview of Audit Approach

### Title of Document: Draft Audit Methodology, Evidence Mapping, and Strengthened Aged Care Quality Standards for Review and Discussion

The Audit Methodology has been designed to ensure a more positive experience for all participants. It supports providers in demonstrating conformance with the strengthened Quality Standards and shows how they apply continuous improvement through ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and enhancement of systems and processes.

It was published in January 2024.

### Purpose of this doccument
The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission is committed to supporting the aged care sector in preparing for the implementation of the strengthened Aged Care Quality Standards. This document provides providers with insight into the guidance and framework that auditors and delegates of the Commission will use to assess provider performance against the strengthened Quality Standards. The audit methodology outlines guidance, key points of consideration, and principles for decision-making while giving an overview of the audit process. It also provides context for the evidence mapping framework that supports auditors.

### Context for the document

In December 2022, the Commission engaged Ernst and Young Australia (EY) to conduct a pilot project to test how the strengthened Quality Standards will apply in practice across relevant aged care settings. This project also aimed to develop a revised audit methodology, guidance documents, tools, and templates for auditors and providers. The objectives of the pilot project were to inform:

* How the draft strengthened Quality Standards can be effectively implemented.
* How the Commission will assess provider performance against the strengthened Quality Standards.
* How the introduction of graded assessment can better differentiate provider performance and drive continuous improvement.
* What support providers will need to understand and meet their obligations under the strengthened Quality Standards, including identifying the guidance and resources needed to support the sector.
* How to best support older people to understand what the strengthened Quality Standards mean for them and what they should expect from their aged care service.

EY and Commission staff conducted 40 pilot audits across a sample of 32 providers that were representative of the aged care sector (service type, size, location, and diversity of people receiving aged care). The 40 pilot audits were undertaken between April and September 2023. Insights from the pilot audits informed an update to the strengthened Quality Standards.

Thank you to those providers, their staff, and recipients of care and services for their participation in the pilot audits. This valuable exercise has enabled the Commission to develop a draft Audit Methodology and Evidence Mapping Framework, which is outlined within this document. The draft Audit Methodology, Evidence Mapping Framework, and associated draft Guidance have been designed as a package, so the individual documents should not be considered in isolation. Together, these documents provide a holistic view to assist providers, workers, and governing bodies in understanding the intent of the strengthened Quality Standards, clarifying new concepts, and considering how to apply them in their service. Providers are also encouraged to review the Request for Information Category 4 & 5 template and Category 6 template, as well as the Pre-Audit Preparation Tool, which providers will be asked to complete as part of the audit process.

### Section 1. Registration categories

### Three Stages of the Audit Process

Audits are conducted in three distinct stages. Under the new Aged Care Act, all registered providers of Commonwealth-funded aged care services will be required to be registered in one or more of the provider registration categories based on the service types they intend to deliver. The Commissioner must be satisfied that a provider meets relevant requirements for registration and re-registration. Audits against the strengthened Quality Standards are a key registration requirement for some registration categories.

On the following page, Table 1 demonstrates the relationship between the proposed registration categories, service types, and the strengthened Quality Standards. There are currently a total of six registration categories proposed. The strengthened Quality Standards and audit process only apply to providers registered to categories 4, 5, and/or 6.

### Section 2. Audit methodology

The Audit Methodology has been developed to provide auditors and delegates of the Commission with a framework and guidance to undertake consistent audits of provider performance against the strengthened Quality Standards. It is expected that the new aged care legislation will set the Outcomes as the enforceable element of the strengthened Quality Standards; therefore, auditors will determine findings of conformance at the Outcome level. This requires auditors to gather and assess evidence at the Outcome level, with the Actions under each Outcome providing guidance about what is required to achieve the Outcome.

Once all provider obligations are finalized under the new Aged Care Act, the Audit Methodology and Evidence Mapping will be refined to ensure alignment with provider obligations such as incident management and governance obligations.

The Audit Methodology sets out guidance, key points of consideration, and principles for decision-making through the course of the audit process. The Audit Methodology supports:
* A consistent approach to conducting audits, where auditors reach similar conclusions about provider performance against the strengthened Quality Standards in similar circumstances.
* A quality audit program that is scalable, efficient, and effective.
* A culture of continuous improvement and innovation in the aged care sector.
* The Commissionâ€™s broader regulatory outcomes, including providing an input into registration and re-registration decisions for providers.

### Auditing Principles

The Commission has adopted principles for the conduct of audits against the strengthened Quality Standards, based on the ISO19011 International Standards for auditing management systems. These include:
* Integrity
* Fair representation
* Diligence and judgment in assessment
* Independence
* Evidence-based approach
* Risk-based approach
* Transparent and accountable
* Safe handling of personal and protected information

### Section 3. Overview of audit approach
There are 3 phases to the audit approach 

#### Stage 1: Audit Preparation and Desktop - relates to the administrative and pre-audit preparation undertaken by both providers and the audit team prior to the audit team conducting on-site activities. This process applies to both provider and service-level audits.

* **Objectives**: 
  - Undertake effective planning
  - Prepare for the audit

* **Key Activities**:
  - Review of Request for Information (RFI) and Pre-Audit Preparation Tool (PAPT)
  - Initial meeting with provider to understand context
  - Selection of sample older people for consultation
  - Fully desktop-based for both registration and re-registration audits

#### Stage 2: Audit Delivery
* **Purpose**: Detailed evidence gathering to inform findings against Outcomes
* **Format**: Combination of desktop and on-site evidence gathering
* **Applicable**: Both registration and re-registration audits

#### Stage 3: Audit Reporting
* **Activities**:
  - Preparation of findings and audit gradings
  - Provider response to Preliminary Audit Report
  - Fully desktop-based
  - Relevant for both registration and re-registration audits

### Digital Audit Tool Implementation

The Commission will implement a new digital audit tool for the transition to strengthened Quality Standards. Benefits include:

* Consistent decision-making
* Structured evidence mapping
* Consolidation of audit data
* Streamlined audit reporting

### Evidence Gathering Process

Evidence will be gathered at both provider and service levels:

#### Provider-Level Evidence
* Focus on systems and processes
* Monitoring performance
* Applicable across all service locations

#### Service-Level Evidence
* Implementation testing
* Understanding older people's experiences
* Care outcome assessment

### Stakeholder Definitions

#### 1. Governing Body
* Responsible for provider governance
* May be called board of directors, trustees, committee, etc.
* Legal requirement for various organizational structures

#### 2. Management
**Provider-Level Management**
* Responsible for day-to-day operations
* Includes:
  - Senior Executives (CEO, COO)
  - Senior/General Managers
* Focus on strategy and system oversight

**Service-Level Management**
* Manages daily service operations
* Includes:
  - Service manager
  - Director of Nursing
* Responsible for implementing systems and processes

#### 3. Workers
* Employees and contractors
* Allied health professionals
* Support staff (kitchen, cleaning, laundry, garden, office)
* Volunteers providing care services

#### 4. Third Parties
* External care service providers
* Regulatory agencies
* Health professionals engaged by older persons
* Other relevant organizations

### Section 4. Evidence gathering and evidence mapping

### Evidence Mapping Framework

The primary purpose of the Evidence Mapping Framework is to support auditors in the evidence gathering process by providing a standardized set of targeted questions and examples of evidence aligned with each of the evidence categories. As outlined in the overview of the audit approach, the Evidence Mapping Framework cannot be used independently of the strengthened Quality Standards Guidance or Audit Methodology. The Framework is to be used in collaboration with these documents to enhance user knowledge and understanding of how the strengthened Quality Standards should be applied.

The Evidence Mapping Framework is not intended to be an exhaustive list of questions and examples of evidence that auditors must try to identify for each theme or Outcome at each audit. Rather, it is designed as a guide to support auditors in identifying the most relevant and high-value evidence. Auditors are encouraged to adjust and adapt the wording or ordering of their questions where necessary (e.g., if it is not being understood by the person being interviewed).

There are a total of 21 themes in the Evidence Mapping Framework, ultimately linking to the 33 Outcomes in the strengthened Quality Standards. The Evidence Mapping Framework is structured in such a way as to differentiate between provider and service-level evidence. Evidence gathered across the range of categories and sources supports greater certainty, accuracy, and reliability in audit findings. Additionally, information or evidence which confirms or supports a statement, issue, risk, or finding is obtained from a range of sources which generally increases assurance that the audit findings are sound, leading to less risk of reaching an incorrect conclusion.

The Evidence Mapping Framework is structured to include:
- Details of the requirements associated with the theme, including links to other Outcomes.
- Examples of documents and records, as well as documents relating to care outcomes at the provider and service-level sorted according to registration category.
- Questions for the key stakeholders as defined in table 3 below, older people and their family, carers and/or representatives, sorted by registration category.
- Examples of observations at the service-level sorted by registration category.

Evidence gathering for audits will be focused on each providerâ€™s systems and processes for delivering safe and quality care and services to understand and test whether the:

1. **Design of the providerâ€™s systems and processes meets the intent of the Outcome/s**
   - Has the provider developed systems, strategies, policies, processes, or procedures to meet the intent of the Outcome?
   - How does the provider ensure that the design of its systems, strategies, policies, processes, or procedures is aligned to contemporary evidence-based practice?
   - How do the systems, strategies, policies, processes, or procedures consider the input of older people and workers?

   2. **Providerâ€™s systems and processes have been implemented in practice, across the services sampled (as relevant)**
      - **Older person lens**: To what extent are provider systems and processes implemented and delivering outcomes for older people? This may be assessed through review of older person care plans, files and records, interviews of older people, family, carers and other representatives, and observations of processes in action.
      - **Worker lens**: To what extent do workers understand their roles and responsibilities and are implementing systems and processes effectively? This may be assessed through interviews of workers, and observations of processes in action.

   3. **Provider monitors the implementation of its systems and processes and takes actions to continuously improve the effectiveness of the systems and processes**
      - How does the provider monitor the implementation of its systems and processes across the services sampled? How does the individual service monitor the implementation of its systems and processes?
      - Are the systems, strategies, policies, processes, or procedures actually achieving the outcomes of the strengthened Quality Standards?
      - How does the provider use its monitoring processes to identify and respond to risks and issues in care and service delivery?
      - What strategies, plans, or actions does the provider and/or service take to improve the effectiveness of the systems and processes?
      - How are older people and workers involved in improving systems and processes?

      ### Additional information

      The older personâ€™s experience of care and services, and care outcomes are highly valued by auditors. While evidence gathering for quality audits focuses on provider systems and processes for delivering safe and quality care and services, the older personâ€™s experience and feedback are crucial to understanding whether the systems and processes established by the provider are achieving their objectives.

      Evidence will be gathered at both the provider and service levels by auditors conducting audits. This supports holistic evidence gathering and improves the efficiency of the audit process. Provider-level evidence is gathered and considered at all associated service locations, environments, and aged care homes. The focus of the provider-level evidence gathering is to understand the systems and processes in place, including those for monitoring performance.

      Service-level evidence gathering will focus more on testing the implementation of systems and processes. This includes understanding the experience of older people and their care outcomes. There may be instances where an aged care home, location, or service environment implements systems and processes different from the providerâ€™s. In these cases, auditors will need to assess the service-level systems and processes against the strengthened Quality Standards, while noting the deviation from the provider-level systems and processes.

When gathering evidence and making findings, auditors consider:

1. **Provider Context**
   * Size and location
   * Nature and quantity of expected evidence

2. **System Performance**
   * Effectiveness against Outcome intent
   * Implementation success

3. **Impact Assessment**
   * EImpact to older people
   * Service quality outcomes

### Section 5. Audit Gradings

| Audit Grading | Description | Guide |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Exceeding | The residential aged care home conforms with every Standard and meets additional criteria that measure performance beyond conformance with the Standards (criteria to be determined). | To be determined |
| Conformance | The provider/service demonstrates established, implemented, monitored, and continuously improved systems and processes to address the requirements of this Outcome. | N/A |
| Minor Non-conformance | Identified opportunities for improvement or gaps in the providerâ€™s systems and processes that are not systemic and do not present high risk. These gaps do not impact the entire system or process and do not pose significant or immediate consequences to the health, safety, and wellbeing of older people or workers. | - Gap is one-off or isolated. - Gap has been self-identified by the provider with plans/actions in place to address it. - Gap is unlikely to significantly impact the system's design and implementation. - Gap presents low consequences or low probability of failure. - Gap can be rectified quickly. |
| Major Non-conformance | The provider/service cannot demonstrate established, implemented, monitored, and/or continuously improved systems and processes to address the requirements of this Outcome. Identified gaps are systemic or present high risk, impacting the entire system or process and posing significant or immediate consequences to the health, safety, and wellbeing of older people or workers. | - Gap occurs frequently. - Gap has not been self-identified by the provider and/or there are no plans/actions in place to address it. - Gap significantly negatively impacts the system's design and implementation. - Gap presents high consequences or high probability of failure. - Gap cannot be rectified quickly. |
