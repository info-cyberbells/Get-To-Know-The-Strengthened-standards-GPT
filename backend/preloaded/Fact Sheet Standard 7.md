# Standard 7: The Residential Community
## Provider Fact Sheet

## Introduction
Strengthened Quality Standard 7 applies only to residential care providers.

When people move into a residential service, the new community becomes a central part of their lives. It's important for people to feel safe, included, and respected. This includes supporting them to continue personal and cultural connections and to take part in the community.

Providers need to organize planned transitions to residential care that can help people maintain their sense of personal and cultural connection.
